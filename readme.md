## Component hierarchy
---
1. Create a components folder in /js directory
2. Now let's create our components
+ App (The container of the entire application)
+ PostList (The list of all our recent posts)
+ Post (The view of a single post)
+ Input (This component allows us to create a new post)
3. In our App component we are going to add one PostList and one Input component to simulate our post.
4. In our PostList component we are going to add a Post, with hardcoded values, just for demonstrative purpose, and check that everything is working correctly.
5. Now we are going to add the “create post” functionality to our input component, lets use axios for that purpose.
